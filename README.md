# Data Analysis Project on Açu Port Vessels

This a project where I use webscraping techniques to get data from Açu Port public line-up in order to analyse main port KPIs.

These KPIs include:

* Waiting Time per terminal & per agency
* Berthed Time per terminal & per agency

I also work on an exploratory data analysis techniques (EDA) to verify features and answer questions such as:

* Which terminal takes longer to operate?
* Which terminal vessel's waiting time is longer or shorter?

This data and insights are useful for owners intending to bring their vessels to operate at Açu Port as well as to other ports wanting to replicate this model to their reality.

It is an ongoing project which is constantly being updated.
